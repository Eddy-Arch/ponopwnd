psalm1: str = "Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of \n" \
              "sinners, nor sat in the seat of the pestilent. But his will is in the law of the Lord, and in his \n" \
              "law shall he meditate day and night. And he shall be like the tree planted by the rivers of waters, \n" \
              "that shall bring forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not fall, and whatsoever he doeth \n" \
              "shall prosper. The ungodly are not so, not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away from \n" \
              "the face of the earth. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the \n" \
              "congregation of the righteous. For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the \n" \
              "ungodly shall perish. "
